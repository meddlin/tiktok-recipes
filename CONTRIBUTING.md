If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/meddlin/tiktok-recipes/issues/new). 

#### Solve an issue

See [Labels](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
