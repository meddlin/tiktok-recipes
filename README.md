# TikTok Recipes

[https://tiktok-recipes.vercel.app/](https://tiktok-recipes.vercel.app/)

A no-nonsense recipes app, based on TikTok videos.

I started having excellent recipe videos recommended to me on TikTok, and 
while the app allows you to create folders in your favorites (excellent 
for revisiting them!)..._you can't share the collection._ On top of that 
sometimes the videos have the recipe in the description, comments, or 
even just text in the video itself.

All in all, not the best way to revisit these recipes to make them later. 
So, I thought this was a good opportunity to create a recipe app to share
them!
