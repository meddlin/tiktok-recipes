TikTok Recipes

After joining TikTok in 2020, I started finding a bunch of great recipe videos! I wanted a way to save and share them, 
but also to actually use them as actual recipes. And since they came with either useful or cool videos, I also wanted 
to give credit back to the original creators by showing the videos next to the recipes.
